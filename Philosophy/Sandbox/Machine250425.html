<h2><span class="section-number">5.1. </span>It seems that all modern philosophies rely on relativism. However, does the relativism exclude the existence of universal things?<a class="headerlink" href="#it-seems-that-all-modern-philosophies-rely-on-relativism-however-does-the-relativism-exclude-the-existence-of-universal-things" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Relativism doesn’t necessarily exclude the existence of universal things. Relativism, properly understood, says that truths, values, or meanings are dependent on context — like historical era, culture, language, individual perspective, etc. But this dependency claim doesn’t logically deny that there might also be universal features of reality, ethics, or knowledge. It just makes us cautious: what seems “universal” might actually be a projection of a particular tradition.</p>
<p>Some thinkers wrestled with this very tension:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Kant, for example, tried to explain that while human experience is “relative” (structured by space, time, and categories of the mind), those structures themselves are universal across all humans.</p></li>
<li><p>Husserl (phenomenology) tried to find universal structures of consciousness even though lived experience is full of cultural and subjective variation.</p></li>
<li><p>Even postmodern thinkers like Derrida or Foucault, who are seen as relativists, occasionally acknowledge that some structures (like “power” or “language games”) might be so pervasive that they function almost universally.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="how-different-philosophers-balance-between-relativism-and-universalism-in-particular-regarding-natural-law">
<h2><span class="section-number">5.2. </span>How different philosophers balance between relativism and universalism? in particular, regarding natural law<a class="headerlink" href="#how-different-philosophers-balance-between-relativism-and-universalism-in-particular-regarding-natural-law" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Natural law is the idea that there are objective moral principles or rules built into human nature or the structure of the world, discoverable by reason. It’s universalist by default: it claims that certain laws apply everywhere and always, not just in certain cultures.</p>
<section id="plato-and-aristotle-classical-natural-law">
<h3><span class="section-number">5.2.1. </span>. Plato and Aristotle (Classical natural law)<a class="headerlink" href="#plato-and-aristotle-classical-natural-law" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Universalist through and through. Plato thought the “Forms” (perfect realities, like Justice, Goodness) existed beyond human opinion — we just have to recognize them. Aristotle was a bit more practical but still believed that human beings have a natural telos (end, purpose) — to live a rational and virtuous life. Even though laws can vary by city and culture, goodness itself is universal. Some relativism (acknowledging cultural variation) but firm belief in a deeper, knowable, universal moral order.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">5.2.2. </span>Aquinas (Medieval natural law)<a class="headerlink" href="#aquinas-medieval-natural-law" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Natural law = participation in God’s eternal law through reason. Every human, regardless of religion or culture, can discover basic moral rules (e.g., “do good, avoid evil”, “protect life”, “seek truth”). Full-on universalism; relativism is only an appearance, caused by ignorance or sin.</p>

<section id="montaigne-early-modern-skepticism">
<h3><span class="section-number">5.2.3. </span>Montaigne (Early modern skepticism)<a class="headerlink" href="#montaigne-early-modern-skepticism" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Traveled, read widely, and concluded that human customs and morals are extremely diverse. Suggested that maybe “natural law” is not so obvious after all, our ideas of good and evil could be deeply culturally shaped. Pessimistic about universalism. Open to natural law but doubtful about how well humans can know it.</p>

<section id="grotius-early-modern-natural-law-revival">
<h3><span class="section-number">5.2.4. </span>Grotius (Early modern natural law revival)<a class="headerlink" href="#grotius-early-modern-natural-law-revival" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The founder of modern international law. Argued for a version of natural law that would hold even if God did not exist (“etsi Deus non daretur”). Believed that reason alone could find basic rules for human coexistence — like keeping promises and not harming others. He tries to ground universal natural law rationally, not theologically — aware of cultural differences, but believes reason can overcome them.</p>

<section id="nietzsche-radical-relativism">
<h3><span class="section-number">5.2.5. </span>Nietzsche (Radical relativism)<a class="headerlink" href="#nietzsche-radical-relativism" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Absolutely anti-natural law. Believed that “universal values” are masks for the “will to power” — different groups impose their values and call them “natural” or “eternal”. “There are no facts, only interpretations.” However, Nietzsche still thought that human beings create meaning, so he’s not a pure nihilist. No belief in universal moral law, but intense focus on how individuals can create personal value.</p>

<section id="leo-strauss-20th-century-defender-of-natural-law">
<h3><span class="section-number">5.2.6. </span>Leo Strauss (20th-century defender of natural law)<a class="headerlink" href="#leo-strauss-20th-century-defender-of-natural-law" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Said that modern relativism had led to moral and political nihilism. Advocated returning to the classical natural law of Plato and Aristotle. Yet Strauss also recognized that natural law can’t simply be assumed anymore — it has to be carefully defended in a skeptical world. Strong universalism, but aware of how powerful relativism has become in modern thought.</p>
<section id="the-basic-problem-strauss-sees">
<h4><span class="section-number">5.2.6.1. </span>The Basic Problem Strauss Sees<a class="headerlink" href="#the-basic-problem-strauss-sees" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Strauss believed that modern philosophy — starting with Machiavelli, Hobbes, and especially culminating in Nietzsche and Heidegger — had abandoned the idea that there is any universal standard of right and wrong. Instead, modernity tends to say that morality is a product of history, culture, or subjective choice.</p>
<p>Strauss thought this led to a crisis:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If there are no universal standards, then everything is permitted.</p></li>
<li><p>Politics becomes a mere struggle for power (relativism -&gt; nihilism -&gt; tyranny).</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="natural-right-instead-of-natural-law">
<h5><span class="section-number">5.2.6.1.1. </span>“Natural Right” instead of “Natural Law”<a class="headerlink" href="#natural-right-instead-of-natural-law" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h5>
<p>Strauss often spoke of natural right rather than natural law. “Law” sounds heavy, religious, or metaphysical. “Right” (as in what is right, just, good) sounds more flexible, more suited to philosophical inquiry rather than dogmatic imposition.</p>
<p>For Strauss, natural right means that there are better and worse ways to live according to human nature. Philosophy’s job is to search for (not invent) what is just by nature.</p>
<p>Strauss does not think it’s easy to know natural right. He acknowledges that it’s hard to find agreement. Different societies and thinkers genuinely disagree — but disagreement doesn’t automatically mean relativism is true. Instead, disagreement is the reason we need philosophy — serious questioning and inquiry into what is truly good.</p>

<section id="thermometer-metaphor">
<h2><span class="section-number">5.3. </span>Thermometer metaphor<a class="headerlink" href="#thermometer-metaphor" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: if i put two thermometers in a glass with water and each one reports a different temperature, does not mean that temperature is subjective or relative. could this example be translated to the notion of natural rights?</p>
<p>Strauss would say something like this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Different cultures or thinkers disagree about what is “right by nature.”</p></li>
<li><p>But that does not prove that there is no natural right!</p></li>
<li><p>It might mean that</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Different societies are like different thermometers — they are trying to measure natural right but some are better calibrated than others.</p></li>
<li><p>Some cultures, customs, or philosophies may have come closer to understanding natural right than others.</p></li>
<li><p>Philosophy’s task is to refine our “instruments” (reason, reflection, dialogue) to get a more accurate reading of natural right.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So cultural disagreement does not mean “no natural right”. Instead, it invites philosophical inquiry: Which understanding is truer? How can we measure better?</p>
<p>If we use the thermometers analogy:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Thermometers = cultures, moral traditions, laws.</p></li>
<li><p>True temperature = natural right, true justice.</p></li>
<li><p>Philosophy = the effort to calibrate our understanding properly, despite human flaws.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Strauss believed the task of the philosopher is similar to the task of the scientist: Don’t give up when instruments disagree, work harder to refine your understanding of the objective reality.</p>
<p>Strauss would also remind us that human beings are not machines like thermometers. Our “instruments” (reason, tradition, judgment) are influenced by desire, fear, pride, ideology. So it’s harder, but not impossible, to find the truth about natural right. It demands philosophical seriousness, openness to questioning, and humility.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>:After that experience with the thermometers, the conclusion is that they are not well calibrated. So I could perform a set of measurements, for example placing the thermometers in boiling water and freezing water, to calibrate them. What would be the equivalent in the philosophical case?</p>
<p>In the thermometer case, one test the thermometers against clear, stable reference points independent of the thermometers (given by Nature)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Boiling water (should be 100°C)</p></li>
<li><p>Freezing water (should be 0°C)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the philosophical case (natural right), we also need reference points — stable realities — to test our judgments about justice, rightness, and good living. But because morality and human life are more complex than physics, the “reference points” are not as simple as boiling water. Strauss (and the classical tradition he respects) suggests two main strategies for calibration:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Extreme Cases (Natural Experiences). Once can calibrate your sense of justice by examining clear and extreme examples — situations so obvious that almost no sane human would deny them. These extreme examples work like boiling and freezing points: they anchor our reasoning and help us see that not all values are purely cultural inventions. Examples:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Murder of the innocent: Almost all humans recognize that senseless killing of innocents is wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Breaking promises without cause: Trust is basic to human life; destroying it arbitrarily seems naturally wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Tyranny vs. Decent Rule: Comparing a mad dictator to a ruler who seeks the common good.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p>Cross-Cultural Comparison and Reasoned Reflection. Look at the best examples of human flourishing across different cultures and histories. Ask:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What kinds of lives lead to happiness, dignity, excellence?</p></li>
<li><p>What kinds of societies respect truth, justice, human dignity better than others?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Through reasoned dialogue, comparison, and self-critique, we can refine our understanding of what is good by nature — just like recalibrating thermometers. It’s not automatic (like a machine), but it’s possible through serious, honest inquiry. Just like scientists constantly refine their instruments and measurements, philosophers must stay open to deeper inquiry. For Strauss, this is why philosophy must stay open-ended — not because truth doesn’t exist, but because human access to truth is always partial.</p>
