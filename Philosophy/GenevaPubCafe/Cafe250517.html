<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The conversation moved quite fast, so I was only able to take note of some of the ideas that were mentioned, mostly in the form of questions.</p>
<section id="initial-questions">
<h2><span class="section-number">3.1. </span>Initial Questions:<a class="headerlink" href="#initial-questions" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How can I ensure I am aware?</p></li>
<li><p>Are inputs from the senses the only ingredient for mental representation of reality? Is this representation useful?</p></li>
<li><p>Is handwriting still functional?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the purpose of negative emotions? Is their accumulation a trigger for breakups?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there such a thing as right or wrong?</p></li>
<li><p>Desire as a motivation for life, or constraint of desire as a source of pain?</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="main-topic">
<h2><span class="section-number">3.2. </span>Main topic<a class="headerlink" href="#main-topic" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The last question was chosen as the topic of the day. The following ideas emerged, mostly gathered as questions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Desire as a natural driving force</p></li>
<li><p>Desire is triggered by the feeling of lacking something</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the difference between desire and needs?</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe the key difference is the power of choosing?</p></li>
<li><p>Fromm makes a distinction between different types of love and emphasizes that real, mature love is not based on need or dependency, which he sees as a more immature or narcissistic form of attachment. Instead, he contrasts it with a giving, selfless kind of love, rooted in care, responsibility, respect, and knowledge. He contrasts “symbiotic union” (love based on need and dependence) with “mature love” (based on freedom and mutual growth). He famously writes, “Immature love says: ‘I love you because I need you.’ Mature love says: ‘I need you because I love you.’”</p></li>
<li><p>Are all needs some kind of desire? There seems to be some intersection, but some needs are not desires</p></li>
<li><p>Distinction between conscious desires vs. unconscious desires?</p></li>
<li><p>Is how to fulfill a desire a conscious decision?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Alienation by chasing fulfillment of desire in external elements?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Are external desires created by society, by creating expectations?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>When a desire is fulfilled, does it create a new one? Reinforcement by a dopamine loop?</p></li>
<li><p>What is a conscious desire?</p></li>
<li><p>Is desire shaped by experience or instincts?</p></li>
<li><p>Is desire a legacy from primitive times?</p></li>
<li><p>Desire as a driving force of progress or will?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the difference between desire and attraction?</p></li>
<li><p>Desire is a slippery concept, not clear how to be aware of the source of it</p></li>
<li><p>How to shield ourselves against external desires?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Consciously weigh expectations from outside differently?</p></li>
<li><p>Check who/what is creating the expectations as a proxy for the source of the desire?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Existential point: how authentic are our ideas?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the relation between desire and free will?</p></li>
<li><p>Is desire linked to ambition?</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="section-number">3.3. </span>Bibliography,<a class="headerlink" href="#bibliography" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Erich Fromm</p>
<p>Key Work: The Art of Loving, To Have or To Be?</p>
<p>Relevance: Fromm’s exploration of love, need, and desire is directly aligned with the theme you discussed. He also addresses how societal values shape personal fulfillment and identity. His concept of “freedom from” vs. “freedom to” ties into questions of free will and authenticity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Baruch Spinoza</p>
<p>Key Work: Ethics</p>
<p>Relevance: Spinoza treats desire (conatus) as the essence of the human being—the striving to persevere in one’s existence. He also explores the role of rational understanding in becoming free and acting consciously, which relates to several questions on awareness and desire.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Jean-Paul Sartre</p>
<p>Key Work: Being and Nothingness</p>
<p>Relevance: Sartre directly engages with freedom, desire, authenticity, and self-deception (bad faith). His existentialist philosophy can clarify discussions around how we form our desires and whether they are truly our own or shaped by societal pressures.</p>
</li>
<li><p>René Girard</p>
<p>Key Work: Deceit, Desire and the Novel, Violence and the Sacred</p>
<p>Relevance: Girard’s theory of mimetic desire argues that human desire is not autonomous but imitative—we desire things because others desire them. This is deeply connected to your group’s questions about external desires, expectations, and societal influence.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Simone Weil</p>
<p>Key Work: Gravity and Grace</p>
<p>Relevance: Weil explores the spiritual and philosophical dimensions of desire, particularly how detachment and attention lead to awareness and authenticity. She also deals with suffering, need, and the pull of the ego, which links with your themes of pain and emotional triggers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Jaak Panksepp (Neuroscience, Affective Science)</p>
<p>Key Work: Affective Neuroscience</p>
<p>Relevance: Panksepp mapped neural systems for emotions and drives (like desire, fear, care, play). His work helps explain the biological roots of motivation, including how dopamine reinforces certain desires</p>
</li>
<li><p>Daniel Kahneman (Psychology, Behavioral Economics)</p>
<p>Key Work: Thinking, Fast and Slow</p>
<p>Relevance: Kahneman distinguishes between two systems of thinking—fast, intuitive thinking and slow, deliberate reasoning. This ties into your discussion about conscious vs. unconscious desire, awareness, and decision-making.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lisa Feldman Barrett (Psychology, Neuroscience)</p>
<p>Key Work: How Emotions Are Made</p>
<p>Relevance: Barrett challenges traditional views of emotion and argues that emotions are constructed by the brain based on context, prediction, and culture. This is very relevant to your questions about external influence and the social construction of desire.</p>
