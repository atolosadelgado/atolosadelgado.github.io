## HEP OS lib

Check this (link)[https://gitlab.cern.ch/linuxsupport/rpms/HEP_OSlibs/-/blob/ubuntu2204/README-ubuntu2204.md]. This lib will install all dependencies needed for HEP software.

## CVMFS

Precompiled software is available in the read-only service `cvmfs`. Service can be installed during the installation of the operative system in case of CERN CentOS, or manually afterwards, installing the `locmap` packages and then enabling that service. Visit the [webpage](https://linux.web.cern.ch/centos7/docs/locmap/) for further details.

There are two software builds of softare, `LGC` and `spack`. There is a daily built of each one, named `nightlies`, and a stable release. Each release may have a hash or version number which identify the status of the software at that time. 

Individual packages can be sourced from both `LGC` and `spack`. Alternatively, all the packages (around 1500) can be sourced with the following command

```shell
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/dev4/latest/x86_64-centos7-gcc11-opt/setup.sh
```

For example, this command sources the latest version of Geant4, ROOT, Qt, DD4hep, etc, for a machine `x86_64` with `centos7` compiled using `gcc11`.

Keep in mind that `cvmfs` service can be enabled in the main machine, and then use a singularity container with `centos7` to use those packages.

Software in `cvmfs` is compiled for a variety of environments (OS + compiler),

```shell
$ ls /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/dev4/latest/
