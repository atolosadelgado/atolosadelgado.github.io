# Geneva Cafe Philosophy (19 April 2025)
----

The conversation moved quite fast, so I was only able to take note of some of the ideas that were mentioned, mostly in the form of questions.

## Initial Questions:
- Does time stop if I stop my internal dialogue?
- How can we bridge the gap between internal thoughts/ideas and reality? How does the jump from creativity to reality happen? (Law of Attraction)
- How can we define the limits of human knowledge?
- If everything is in continuous motion, how can anything remain at rest?
- How do aesthetics relate to ethics or rational thinking? Are they a cause or a consequence? Are they a scaling factor or a critical factor that determines the flow of thought?
- Is mystery necessary to balance personal life, or to achieve well-being?

The last question was chosen as the topic of the day. The following ideas emerged, mostly gathered as questions:
- In what way does limited knowledge shape our beliefs?
- How can we live with infinite ignorance?
- How can we model our ignorance? Can we define its boundaries?
- Is ignorance necessary to keep us humble?
- Knowledge brings determinism, which can be boring.
- Do we need a minimum level of security to explore the unknown?
- Does mystery create hope?
- Do we have an innate tendency to want to know the unknown?
- How can we deal with mystery at the societal level?
- Is mystery a mental model of unknown reality?
- Mystery is not simply the unknown, it involves certain feelings.
- Are different versions required for becoming a mystery?
- Is mystery just an outlier in our mental representation of reality?
- Is faith (in our mental representation of reality, which gives us a sense of security) necessary to live?
- Mystery can arise when faith (our mental model of reality) is questioned.
- Faith captures the most likely outcome, according to our model of the world.
- But faith is also required for rare or improbable things to happen.

## Afterthoughts

Several concepts related to physics were touched upon:

- **Limitations of determinism**: A lack of infinite knowledge (e.g. Laplace's demon), or chaos (as in nonlinear systems), may force us to use approximations such as statistics. In some cases, randomness may be irreducible and intrinsic to nature (as in the chaotic behavior of a pendulum in classical mechanics).

- **Infinite ignorance**: Asimov, and probably others, proposed the idea of *asymptotic knowledge*, we can approach the "truth" more and more closely, even if we never fully reach it. This pursuit is still valuable. In addition, as was mentioned during the Caf√©, we can sometimes model our ignorance and even define its limits.

- **In science**, instead of faith, a similar idea is used: the *working hypothesis*. Research is typically centered on testing these hypotheses and building further ideas on top of previous knowledge.
