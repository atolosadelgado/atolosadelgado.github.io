## When it is justified to reinvent the wheel?

In general to go further, we have to avoid wasting resources in reinventing the wheel. However, there is a risk we forget how to make the wheel, or the motivation that cause the invention of the wheel in first place (by wheel I mean any project or idea in general)


Focus instead on building upon previous solutions. (e.g., don't design a new wheel every time you make a cart — use the standard design and innovate elsewhere.) This approach values efficiency and accumulation of knowledge.

If we never "reinvent the wheel," don't we risk forgetting why the wheel was invented, how it works, and what possibilities it originally opened? Isn't the act of re-inventing itself valuable — for understanding, for creativity, for resilience?

### Preserving Deep Understanding

If we only inherit finished products without rebuilding them ourselves, we risk superficial knowledge. True mastery often comes from going through the process. Example:
* A carpenter understands wood better by making a wheel, not just using one.
* A mathematician understands geometry better by re-proving classic theorems, not just memorizing results.

"Reinvention" trains our minds and keeps skills alive.

### Recovering Forgotten Context and Motivation

Every invention was born from specific needs, pressures, and imaginative leaps. If we only accept finished products, we forget what problems they solved and why they mattered. By "reinventing," we reconnect with the spirit of invention itself — not just the final result. Philosophical example: Socrates doesn't just tell you what justice is — he forces you to "reinvent" your understanding of it through questioning.

### Opening Space for True Innovation

If we only accept handed-down solutions, we become conformist. Reinventing the wheel sometimes leads to better wheels — unexpected improvements or entirely new approaches. True innovation often comes from first rethinking the basics.

### Resilience and Independence

Civilizations that depend on inherited knowledge without actively reproducing it become fragile. If conditions change, or technology fails, they may not know how to rebuild. Reinventing keeps foundational knowledge alive and ensures it’s adaptive to new circumstances. Historical example: When the Roman Empire fell, much knowledge was lost — only societies that actively rebuilt understanding survived and advanced.

### Philosophical Angle: Plato and the Anamnesis Idea

Plato thought that learning is a kind of remembering (anamnesis). To truly "know," you don’t just accept external answers; you must reawaken the truth inside yourself by inquiry and struggle. In this spirit, reinventing the wheel isn't wasteful — it's recovering a deeper, inner capacity. Reinventing is remembering at a higher level.

### Conclusion: When Should We Reinvent the Wheel?

* When we risk losing understanding.
* When conditions have changed and old solutions may not fit anymore.
* When seeking real innovation, not just surface improvements.
* When training new generations in how to think, not just what to think.
