# Geneva Pub Philosophy (23 April 2025)
----

## Initial Question:
- How are aesthetics connected to ethics/rational thinking? Is it a cause, a consequence, or part of it? To what extent does aesthetics influence decision-making?

I gathered the following ideas, either discussed during the meeting or personal thoughts:
- Are ethics and aesthetics relative?
- Are they generated by society, and later individually learned from it?
- Is aesthetics fully subjective?
- How do ethics function at a societal level? And aesthetics?
- Are value judgments affected by aesthetics? And vice versa? Several examples were proposed:
    - Michael Jackson
    - Hitler's actress, who was later not allowed to participate in films after 1945
    - The book Lolita by Nabokov (personal note: check for the reference)
- In the last millennia, men dominated aesthetics; did this have an impact on ethics?
- Is there a gender gap in how aesthetics is interpreted?
- If we make the mental exercise of separating the content from the structure of a piece of art, it may remain aesthetically pleasing but without any ethical implication. Does ethics relate to the content, while aesthetics relates to both content and structure?
- Are beauty and aesthetics different? Is beauty contained within aesthetics?
- Does beauty imply a personal experience, while aesthetics refers to something more universal?
- Does "aesthetically pleasing" mean the same as "beauty"?
- Brutalist art, like buildings made entirely of concrete, is an example of something not beautiful but still aesthetic
- Another example: the essence of tragedy may not be beautiful, maybe even revolting, but is it still aesthetic?
- Another example: Salò, by Pasolini—disgusting at first, but if interpreted as a metaphor for capitalism, its appreciation may change
- Does aesthetics aim to connect/engage feelings?
- Why is art linked to aesthetics? Could it simply be empathy trying to connect the piece of art with the individual?
- Is shocking art aesthetic or ethical? E.g., the 2 million euro banana taped to the wall, later eaten as a regular banana
- Is the economy a way to give each person what they need and want, or are there other motivations?
- Since ethics and aesthetics are learned, are both susceptible to manipulation or distortion?
- Is aesthetics more based on instincts/natural tendencies, while ethics is more rational?
- Is aesthetics an emergent property of a society?
