# Geneva Pub Philosophy (23 April 2025)
----

## Initial Question:
- How are aesthetics connected to ethics/rational thinking? Is it a cause, a consequence, or part of it? To what extent does aesthetics influence decision-making?

I gathered the following ideas, either discussed during the meeting or personal thoughts:
- Are ethics and aesthetics relative?
- Are they generated by society, and later individually learned from it?
- Is aesthetics fully subjective?
- How do ethics function at a societal level? And aesthetics?
- Are value judgments affected by aesthetics? And vice versa? Several examples were proposed:
    - Michael Jackson
    - Hitler's actress, who was later not allowed to participate in films after 1945
    - The book Lolita by Nabokov (personal note: check for the reference)
- In the last millennia, men dominated aesthetics; did this have an impact on ethics?
- Is there a gender gap in how aesthetics is interpreted?
- If we make the mental exercise of separating the content from the structure of a piece of art, it may remain aesthetically pleasing but without any ethical implication. Does ethics relate to the content, while aesthetics relates to both content and structure?
- Are beauty and aesthetics different? Is beauty contained within aesthetics?
- Does beauty imply a personal experience, while aesthetics refers to something more universal?
- Does "aesthetically pleasing" mean the same as "beauty"?
- Brutalist art, like buildings made entirely of concrete, is an example of something not beautiful but still aesthetic
- Another example: the essence of tragedy may not be beautiful, maybe even revolting, but is it still aesthetic?
- Another example: Salò, by Pasolini—disgusting at first, but if interpreted as a metaphor for capitalism, its appreciation may change
- Does aesthetics aim to connect/engage feelings?
- Why is art linked to aesthetics? Could it simply be empathy trying to connect the piece of art with the individual?
- Is shocking art aesthetic or ethical? E.g., the 2 million euro banana taped to the wall, later eaten as a regular banana
- Is the economy a way to give each person what they need and want, or are there other motivations?
- Since ethics and aesthetics are learned, are both susceptible to manipulation or distortion?
- Is aesthetics more based on instincts/natural tendencies, while ethics is more rational?
- Is aesthetics an emergent property of a society?

## Books Tackling Aesthetics, Ethics, and Rationality

These are a few books that caught my attention, though I haven’t read them yet. Since I’m already familiar with Darwin, Pinker, and Piaget, I listed their books first.

1. "The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals" by Charles Darwin

    Focus: Evolutionary psychology of emotion and aesthetics.

    Relevance: Early exploration of aesthetics as instinctual, rooted in evolution.

2. "The Blank Slate" by Steven Pinker

    Focus: Human nature and the denial of biology in culture.

    Relevance: Examines how cultural values (ethics, aesthetics) may be biologically influenced.

3. "The Moral Judgment of the Child" by Jean Piaget

    Focus: Ethical development in children.

    Relevance: Piaget (a scientist/psychologist) explores how ethical reasoning develops, which can be juxtaposed with learned aesthetic values.

4. "How Pleasure Works" by Paul Bloom

    Focus: Psychology and neuroscience of pleasure, including art and morality.

    Relevance: Investigates instinctive vs. learned appreciation—perfect for questions on subjectivity and manipulation.

5. "The Sense of Beauty" by George Santayana

    Focus: Aesthetic theory; early link between aesthetics and human psychology.

    Relevance: Discusses whether beauty is subjective or universal, and how it relates to experience.

    Perspective: Philosopher with strong psychological leanings.

6. "Aesthetics and Ethics: Essays at the Intersection" edited by Jerrold Levinson

    Focus: Directly on the interface between ethical and aesthetic values.

    Relevance: Essays on how aesthetic judgments affect or reflect ethical thinking.

7. "The Cultural Politics of Emotion" by Sara Ahmed

    Focus: Emotions, politics, and cultural aesthetics.

    Relevance: Explores how aesthetics and feelings shape social ethics and vice versa.

8. "Art as Experience" by John Dewey

    Focus: Pragmatist philosophy of art.

    Relevance: Considers how aesthetics, ethics, and democratic experience intertwine.

    Perspective: Dewey blurs lines between rational thought, emotion, and ethics.

9. "The Abuse of Beauty: Aesthetics and the Concept of Art" by Arthur C. Danto

    Focus: Art, beauty, and postmodernism.

    Relevance: Explores whether beauty is necessary for art, and its ethical implications (e.g., Pasolini, banana-art).

10. "On Beauty and Being Just" by Elaine Scarry

    Focus: Justice and beauty.

    Relevance: Argues that beauty can lead to a desire for justice; bridges ethics and aesthetics in a poetic yet rational way.
